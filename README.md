# TeronAutoMark

## An addon which automatically marks the currently targeted enemy or friend.

## What does it do?

This addon is still under development, so use it of your own accord.
It provides the ability to cycle between the 8 in-game raid marks (Skull, Cross, Square, Moon, Triangle, Diamond, Circle and Star), assigning a new mark to eachnewly targeted mob (creating an automatic kill order for up to 8 targets).

## Know Issues
- The addon works, somewhat, but I still need to update the marking cycle, so that it properly resets when exiting combat and starts from Skull each time the players enters combat
- The addon requires a function to be called when attacking each new mob (after the player enters combat), so it can mark each mob individually. I need to work on making the process slighly more automated.
